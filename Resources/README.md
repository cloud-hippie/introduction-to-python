# Python Review

We are reviewing Python. To review, we will create two projects.

# Password Generator Project

A password generator is a perfect way to show comprehension of some of the basics of Python.

It uses strings, integers, booleans, and lists to create a password. The password is then printed to the screen.

## Installation

Within the `password-generator` directory, run the following command:

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

This will install all of the needed dependencies and build the project.

You will now be able to run

```bash
pass-gen --help
```

Which will show you all of the options available to you.

## Assignment

Add your own functionality to the password generator:

1. Add the ability for the user to specify an output file.
2. Add an option for the user to specify a silent output (just put the password in a file).
3. Add an option to output the password as base64 encoded.
4. Add an option for the user to use real words within the password.

# Tiny API Project

The Tiny API is a minimal API built to help students learn about APIs.

It focusses on objects, methods and classes.

The installaiton instructions are within the `tiny-api` directory.

# Pet-Pal

An API project focussing on dictionaries, JSON and Classes.

API's are a great way to create a web application. They are also highly dependant on a user knowing how to parse JSON and traverse dictionaries.
