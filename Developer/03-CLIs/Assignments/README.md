# Yamler - Yaml for ers 

Yaml is a human-friendly data serialization format. It is a subset of [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON). It allows users to write data in a human-friendly format.

Unfortunately, sometimes it can be hard to write. 

We want to make a tool that will allow us to just give a series of values and they will be converted to a yaml file.

This will help us to write our data in a human-friendly format. It will also help show hown you understand Classes, CLIs and Python dependencies.


# Assignment

1. Create a repo called yamler.
2. Create a virtual enviropnment for that repo. Use any of the possible virtual environment creators, so long as you document which one the repo was used with and how the user can get started.
3. Within that virtual environment, install the following dependencies:
    - click
    - pyyaml

4. Create an `__init__.py` file in the root of the repo. 
5. Create a `cli.py` file in the root of the repo.
6. Create a `schema.py` file in the root of the repo.
7. Create a `setup.py` file in the root of the repo.

Using the example within the `CLI` folder, create a `yamler` command line interface.
