## Code

When we were testing our code with the `02-Testing` and `01-PythonBasics` projects, we were using the `pytest` package to test our code.

Now that we know we have functions that work lets create a CLI that will allow us to interact with our code.

Within the world of Python, there are many different ways to create a CLI. We are going to use a combination of `setuptools`, which is a package manager, and `click` which is a package that allows us to create a CLI.

## Assignments

An assignment that will help us learn about CLI's more and YAML.
