# TDD - Using Tests for the Development of Software

As software grows, the need for testing grows.

We write tests to be able to test our assertions and make sure our code is working as expected.

This is a good way to make sure that our code is working as expected and that we don't have any bugs.

It also makes sure that we don't have any typos or errors.

It also makes sure that we don't have any unexpected behavior.

It also allows us to develop faster and more efficiently.


# Getting started

This repo uses `pipenv` if you do not have it please use `pip install pipenv` to install it.

Once downloaded, within the root of this repo, run `pipenv install` to install all the dependencies.


# Folder Structure

`/challenges` - These are coding challenges to be completed by students.
`/tests` - A testing suite for those challenges.

If you run `pytest` in this directory, it will run all the tests within the `tests` folder.

Each test is named after the file it is testing. While this is not a requirement for testing to work, it helps organiza the tests.
