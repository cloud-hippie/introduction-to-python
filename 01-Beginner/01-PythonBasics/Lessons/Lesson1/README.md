# Lesson 1 - Data Types

Datatypes are the building blocks of programming. They are the smallest units of data that can be stored in a variable.

A variable is a way for users to be able to stora a value to be used later.

We can store a value in a variable by using the = sign. 

Each of the possible datatypes have a corresponding file name within this repo.
